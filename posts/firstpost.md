Good evening everyone. I’ve been reading through your papers, putting out fires with clients, and slowly watching spring arrive here in western New York. I hope that you are all safe and well. I’ve had several of you ask when the assignment was going to give for the week. The quick response is that the only new task is to read chapter 5,*The Workplace* in *Becoming a Successful Graphic Designer*. The author does an excellent job outlining the specific roles within design studios and agencies. Knowing who is responsible for what in a studio will help you set the goals necessary to move your career forward, evaluate the nature of work while going through the interview process, and better understand the design industry.

For your amusement, here are a few words of illustrating just how naïve I was when I graduated with a BFA 20 years ago. In my business of design course, I was asked to write a 5-year plan of where I wanted to be as a designer. Art & Creative Direction I assertively wrote in a paper riddled with typos and run-on sentences. I had no clue what either of these titles meant. I had seen them on job boards and met a few individuals. My mentor and professor, assuming I knew more than I did, questioned my choices. I can see now that they were doing their best to steer me in a different direction. My naivety came from a belief that every corporation was eager to hire young activists.

I was wrong. However, by being wrong, I learned more about the discipline. I learned humility and the importance of communicating your worth to future employers, institutions, and collaborators. This morning, just before the fog of zoom meetings settled in, I found myself watching a [livestream](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_CsP6bCvTa/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) event of Alice Rawsthorn talking with the director of [Vitrae Design Museum ](http://shop.design-museum.de/)about her work, research, and thoughts on design post-pandemic. Her books Hello World! And Design is an Attitude are worthwhile reads. As a writer who has focused on the design industry, Rawsthorn sees our industry from an interesting perspective. She is planning more talks on Instagram and if you are not currently following her I recommend you begin.

I’ll see you all on Monday, where we will talk more about the workplace and your responses to the ethic’s readings. Don’t forget to send your progress or questions through the dropbox file request.

Stay safe
